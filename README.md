# My Gem Tarot

I originated, mocked-up, and programmed a Swift 5.3 iOS application. I made an asynchronous API call to the’ Tarot Card Meanings REST API’. I developed and styled each view and created models for data. I implemented CoreData to save data persistently and perform CrUD operations on each reading. I bound data from models to views using property wrappers and developed views to navigate though tarot card and gem information by card suit.

# Features

2. View reading information 
3. Add reading information (title, date, and notes)
4. Edit reading information
5. Delete reading information
